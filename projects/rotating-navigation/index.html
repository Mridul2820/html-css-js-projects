            <p>Trainers,</p>
            <p>
                If you’ve ever played one of the main series Pokémon games, you know how exciting it can be to see another Trainer on your journey. There’s nothing quite like testing your own Pokémon against someone else’s, and it’s always fun to see how each Trainer expresses themself with their team! Today, we’re thrilled to announce that you’ll soon be able to have that experience in Pokémon GO—and you might just become one of the new Trainer characters in the game!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Event-exclusive Trainer characters will be appearing on the map during Pokémon GO Tour: Kanto</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                During the Pokémon GO Tour: Kanto event, you’ll see Trainer characters on the in-game map. You’ll be able to find and battle these Trainer characters regardless of whether you have a ticket for the Pokémon GO Tour: Kanto event. There will even be special Timed Research that rewards you for battling these Trainers! We hope encountering these Trainers on your Pokémon journey and engaging them in battle will help recreate the original Pokémon Red and Pokémon Green gameplay experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Who will these Trainers be, exactly? Well, one of them could be you!

                <strong>How to become a featured Trainer character during Pokémon GO Tour: Kanto</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                We’ll be holding a competition to decide which Trainers will appear as in-game characters during the event. To enter, simply post your entry on Twitter by Monday, January 11, 2021, at 11:59 p.m. PST (GMT −8) and include the following elements.

                <strong>1.</strong> 
                A screenshot of your Trainer profile that includes your Trainer name and shows off your avatar’s outfit.

                <strong>2.</strong> 
                A list of three Pokémon that would make up your team. These Pokémon must be among those originally discovered in the Kanto region and cannot include Ditto, or any Legendary or Mythical Pokémon.

            <p>We will be judging your entries based on the following criteria.</p>
            <p>
                Try giving yourself a theme, like a cool and dynamic Electric-type Trainer or a fluid and powerful Water-type Trainer. Maybe you want to show off that you’re on Team Instinct, Team Mystic, or Team Valor? The possibilities are endless—this is your chance to make your mark on Pokémon GO, so have fun with your Trainer character’s design!
            </p>
            <p>
                We look forward to your entries! Let’s GO!
